**Project Title:
Global Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard**

**Project Overview:**
This project involved the end-to-end analysis of a global retail dataset, covering sales, profit, shipping, and discount performance across 147 countries. Using Excel’s advanced visualization and dashboarding capabilities, I developed an interactive performance monitoring tool to identify high-performing markets, unprofitable segments, and strategic opportunities for growth.

**Objectives:**
1. Assess global sales and profit performance by country, region, and product category.

2. Identify top revenue-generating customers and high-profit product lines.

3. Detect unprofitable markets and product segments for corrective action.

4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve profit margins and operational efficiency.

**Key Features of the Dashboard:**
1. **Global Performance Metrics:** Total sales ($12.64M), average profit, shipping costs, discounts.

2. **Regional & Country Analysis:** Profitability mapping with top and bottom performers.

3. **Product Performance Insights:** Top profit-generating products and least profitable categories.

4. **Customer Value Analysis:** Identification of most valuable customers and purchasing patterns.


**Key Insights Delivered:**
1. The United States and Australia were the most profitable markets, with office furniture and electronics leading product performance.

2. Southeast Asia’s chair category had significant negative profit margins due to high shipping costs and low selling prices.

3. Certain US cities (e.g., Concord, Toledo) showed consistent losses despite high sales volumes.

4. Shipping costs in some product categories were nearly equal to average profits, heavily impacting margins.

5. A small number of high-value customers contributed significantly to total revenue, presenting upsell opportunities.

**Recommendations Implemented:**
1. Optimize shipping through local sourcing and regional distribution hubs to cut logistics costs.

2. Refocus marketing efforts on high-margin regions and products.

3. Adjust pricing strategy in low-margin markets and discontinue unprofitable SKUs.

4. Develop a VIP loyalty program for top customers to increase repeat high-value purchases.
